Hi, 

My name is Andrei Kuniutka. Having gone from Sales Intern to Sales 
Director in a top Russian bank, now I am walking a similar path as 
a backend developer--to realize myself in that of my passions, too.

I code in several languages, but I do love Java for a combo of OOP, 
speed, memory safety. And the fact that Java is very popular in finance
is an extra "for", of course.

My stack:
- Java
- Spring, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud
- JDBC, Hibernate, Flyway
- PostgreSQL, MySQL
- REST API, Kafka, gRPC
- Docker
- Maven
- Git (you knew it!)

Some of my projects are pinned below. Hope you find ones interesting.

Have you any idea or question, please contact me via email
